The official repo of [Res-VMamba: Fine-Grained Food Category Visual Classification Using Selective State Space Models with Deep Residual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15761) , the most part of code is modified from [VMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba)


## Get started
Please follw the installation flow on [VMamba](https://github.com/MzeroMiko/VMamba) , and rename and replace the `resvmamba.py` in this repo to the `vmemba.py` in `models` folder.

## Pretrain-weight
The Res-VMamba model best weight with VMamba-S as backbone trained on CNFOOD-241-Chen (CNFOOD-241 dataset with the random split in the paper) can be available on the [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/ms57rd/Res-VMamba) .
